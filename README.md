### Project Overview

Analysis of 7,865 restaurants across Swiggy to identify profitable cloud kitchen opportunities. Analyzed competition density, pricing strategies, geographic positioning, and delivery performance to develop a market entry strategy.

#### Key Insights

Market Gaps Identified:

* Premium Asian Fusion (Korean, Japanese, Indonesian) shows low competition with high profitability potential
* ₹500-700 price point offers optimal rating-profitability balance (4.2+ ratings achievable)
* Strategic locations (Girish Park, Vardhman Premium Mall, Esplanade) have minimal competition with high ratings
* Only 15% of restaurants deliver under 40 minutes - significant speed advantage opportunity

Strategic Recommendations

* ⚡ Optimize for <40 Minute Delivery through strategic location: 25% faster than market average (53.6 mins), Improves ratings by 0.3-0.5 points through better food quality

* 💰 Price Between ₹500-700 for optimal rating-profitability balance: Balances quality perception with accessibilit, targets 4.2+ rating achievement

* 👍 Cloud Kitchen Model = lower investment and higher flexibility: reduced overhead compared to traditional restaurants, ability to test and pivot quickly based on market response
